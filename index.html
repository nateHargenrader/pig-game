        <h1>The Rules!</h1>
        <h2>The goal of the game is to try to score 100 points. Each round a player can roll as many times as they want but if they roll a one then the turn is over and all points are lost from that round. When a player wants to quit rolling on their turn they can hit the hold button and end their turn. <br> First to 100 wins! Good Luck!! </h2>
